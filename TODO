Planned improvements:

- ignore comments in ledger file
  http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Commenting-on-your-Journal

- provide a hook mechanism to generate special entries:
  read specs from a user-provided clojure source file:
  functions to match on transaction data and generate the
  data to go into the ledger entry
  (eg. for LÃ–N, include rent deduction)
